Student "Chat" Assignment
Create a program with a collection of students from the class. Remember that students in the class are unique, and can therefore only be in the collection once. The Student object has a First and Last name and a score. Each of these students will be added to a Group object with one other student, and these Groups will be in an ordered collection by the first/last name of student 1 in the group.

Also, each student will contain chat responses. Each Student should have a separate collection of chat responses, each with at least 5 different responses. The responses should be ordered, as conversation responses. Per-student responses should be unique, but the same responses can be repeated in different student objects, for example both Student 1 and Student 4 can say "Hi", but only once each.

Use these Students to create conversation pairs and display the conversation between each pair as output. This is in preparation for a chat client which will begin with next weeks' labs, so make sure to use good Object Oriented principles in your design, so that you can use the methods and classes you create this week in upcoming labs. Remember also to use the correct collection types for the requirements.

The project is to be done individually, with submission by demo and uploading to GitHub. For this assignment, create your own GitHub repository to upload to, and send me the link (make sure I can view the repository). My GitHubuser ID is "tcmarsh," and the email address associated is "trevormarsh@mail.weber.edu"

Example output:

Student 1: Hello
Student 2: Hi
Student 1: Well, this is weird
